Exploring idea of building CQRS + DDD + Event Sourcing framework with Akka using Java.


General View
-------

When you are going to build domain centric app it's good point to separate Domain API, Domain and View. Separating change requests from reading requests might be another good idea.  Putting this idea together with ideas of extracting Domain Events we will get us next abstract representation:


![Abstract][1]

*API* consist from *Commands* and *Events*. Commands are something we want to happen, and Events are something that has happened.

*Domain* handles Commands and produce Events. It should be described in terms of *Aggregates*, *Sagas*, *Command Handlers*, *Services*, *Repositories*.

*View* consumes events generated by Domain. It should make system prepare for read requests.


Sample
-------

Let's consider sample for registration with email confirmation.

###API
####Commands

@include ./samples/simpleshop/src/main/java/com/eventor/simpleshop/api/registration/RegisterRequest.java
@include ./samples/simpleshop/src/main/java/com/eventor/simpleshop/api/registration/ConfirmEmail.java

####Events
@include ./samples/simpleshop/src/main/java/com/eventor/simpleshop/api/registration/PersonRegistered.java

###Domain
@include ./samples/simpleshop/src/main/java/com/eventor/simpleshop/domain/Registration.java

###View
@include ./samples/simpleshop/src/main/java/com/eventor/simpleshop/view/UsersList.java
